            frame's posed state (default True).
        scale_factor: Uniform scale applied to exported geometry (default 1.0).

    Returns:
        Dict with keys:
        - success: true on success
        - format: ``"Wavefront Object"``
        - output_path: path written
        - exported_nodes: list of node labels included in the export
        - node_count: number of exported nodes
        - apply_current_pose, scale_factor: echoed settings

    Examples:
        daz_export_obj("C:/exports/hero_base.obj")
        daz_export_obj("C:/exports/suit.obj", node_labels=["Sci-Fi Suit"])
        daz_export_obj("C:/exports/hero_base.obj", scale_factor=0.01)

    Notes:
        OBJ does not support morph targets or animations.  Use ``daz_export_fbx``
        when you need those features.  Raises ToolError if the OBJ exporter is
        not installed.
